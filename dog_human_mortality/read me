This repository contains R code and some of the data needed to complete the analysis of [citation].

Mortality analyis in the Precision Cohort of the Dog Aging Project (DAP)
Users will need to obtain additional data from Terra (https://terra.bio), which requires a data use agreement.
There are two folders: code/ and data/ that contain R code and data that are unique to this study.  

Analysis flow:
1. Metabolome Data, aqueous plasma metabolome (Terra)
  a. Normalize and merge with sample metadata
  b. Adjust for technical effects
  c. Merge with DAP survey data (Terra)
  d. Convert to longitudinal format
  e. Merge the genome relatedness matrix (GRM, Terra)

2. Mortality analysis, Model all-cause mortality as a function of plasma metaboplites along with covariates
  a. Fit Cox proportional hazards (coxPH) mixed models
  b,

3. Correlation between human mortality associations and dog mortality associations in the plasma metabolome
  a. Load summary statistics (e.g. HR and P values) for huamn studies of mortality associations withing the plasma metabolome.
  b. Identify metabolites measures in both human and in dog plasma and harmonize the metabolite IDs/names.
  c. Merge human and dog mortality statistics by metabolite
  d. Examine correlation and concordance among human and dog mortality associations.
